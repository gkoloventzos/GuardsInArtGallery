An implementation of positioning guards in an art gallery with the approach of visibility polygons

##Problem definition
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery_problem

Implementation of visibility polygons approach for finding where guards 
should be posted in an art gallery. The algorithm for the visibility polygons
came from the book:
Computational geometry: a modern algorithmic approach (in Greek), I.Z. Emiris, Klidarithmos, Athens 2008

##Solution
A video in youtube was recorded with some sample poylgons
